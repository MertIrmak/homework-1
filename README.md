# Neon Number Checker 🔢  

This is a simple Java program to check whether a given number is a **Neon Number**.  

## What is a Neon Number? 🤔  
A **Neon Number** is a number whose sum of digits of its square is equal to the original number.  

For example:  
- **9 is a Neon Number**  
  - \( 9^2 = 81 \)  
  - \( 8 + 1 = 9 \) ✅ (Equal to original number)  

- **12 is NOT a Neon Number**  
  - \( 12^2 = 144 \)  
  - \( 1 + 4 + 4 = 9 \) ❌ (Not equal to original number)
